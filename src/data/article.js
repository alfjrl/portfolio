      description:
        "We started an inclusive design project doing the co-design with a participant with a hearing impairment to find customized solutions to solve challenges that happened in her daily life. Most of the solutions that we came across focus on deaf people, which is not the case for our participant. We would like to explore her unique experiences, identify technology exclusions that she faces in her daily activities, and devise technological solutions to address the problems.",
