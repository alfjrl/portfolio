Before that, we needed to solve the significant usability issues for the best user experience and reduce the workload for the customer service team. We started with conducting user research toÂ understand the current usability issues of the service and users' experiences and expectations. Based on the insights, we redesigned key features and rolled out the service to all of the users in Taiwan.",
